/*This Manager class is responsible for associating a position or role to a specific sector
of the company. This class will be of great importance in this program because it will prevent
that when generating an employee randomly, this employee will be related to a non-corresponding
sector, for example: Doctor in the It sector, or Nurse in the Human Resources.
This class will be used in other classes as Employee, GenerateRandomEmployee and Main Class.

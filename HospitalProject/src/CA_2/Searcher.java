/*
This class will be responsible for searching for a person through the user's input
with the person's first and last name to be located in the list. For this to happen,
I needed to create two methods in this class:

1 - binarySearchByName: This method is used to perform the search trhought the binary
search algorithm, in a recursive format, keeping the code more organized and simple.
Binary Search works by dividing the list of person object in two parts in every iteration,
when executed, it will search for the index of a person in the list, where the full name
will be provided by the user when inserting the input.

2- searchByName: This method was used only to perform a processing of the String sent by
the user throught the input. When entering the name to be searched, this method will process the string,
removing extras spaces and transforming letters into lowercase, to make the search more accurate.

The choice for a binary search algorithm was due to the efficiency of this type of algorithm,
as it has a time complexity classified as O(log n), that is, its execution time increases
logarithmically according to the increase in elements, which becomes much more efficient than
other search algorithms, such as the Linear.

Because it has the possibility of increasing the size of the list, with possible expansion of
the hospital, and consequently an increase in the database, the binary search algorithm becomes
more scalable than the Liner.

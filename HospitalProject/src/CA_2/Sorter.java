/*
This class is responsible for sorting a list of people (employees) in ascending order.
To do this, this class will use the MergeSort Algorithm. This algorithm works by dividing
the list into sublists until the individuality of these sublists is reached. After these
subdivisions, the merge is done again, ordering item by item, placing them in their proper
positions, so that the ascending order is maintained. Due to this process, this algorithm receives
the characteristic of 'divide and conquer', that is, it performs several divisions and solves
them one by one unitl it achieves the final objective, which is to recombine all the sublists
to sort the list as a whole. I chose to use this algorithm because it has a time complexity of
O(n log n), and is extremely efficient, and for the hospital project where over the years the
amount of information to be stored in the database will grow exponentially, the Merge algorithm 
will continue to be efficient because it can work efficiently even with large amount of elements.

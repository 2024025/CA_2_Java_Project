/*
This class is responsible for reading data from a .txt file, where each line
will have a first name and a surname, separated by comma. When reading this file,
line by line, the data will be stored in two arrays(name and surname). These names
and surnames can be accessed in other classes due to the getter methods (getName
and getSurname)
